        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fish and chips is a classic British comfort food that pairs flaky white fish—traditionally cod
            or haddock—dipped in a crisp, golden batter with thick-cut, fluffy-on-the-inside chips (fries).
            The fish is deep-fried until perfectly crunchy, while the chips are either double-fried or oven-roasted
            for maximum texture. This hearty dish is typically served with a wedge of lemon, a sprinkle of salt and malt
            vinegar, and often accompanied by sides like mushy peas or tartar sauce.</p>
        <p>
            Beloved across the UK and beyond, fish and chips is more than just a meal—it's a nostalgic experience
            often tied to seaside towns, paper-wrapped takeaways, and Friday night rituals. The secret to getting
            it just right lies in a cold, fizzy batter (often with beer or soda water) and properly drained oil to
            keep things light, not greasy. Whether homemade or grabbed from the local chippy, it's a satisfying blend
            of crunch, tenderness, and savory indulgence.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep the potatoes: Peel and cut potatoes into thick chips. Soak in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch, then drain and pat dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Make the batter: Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and cold beer or sparkling water until you get a smooth, thick batter. Chill the batter in the fridge while you work on the chips.</li>
            <li>Fry the chips (first round): Heat oil to 160°C (320°F) and fry the chips in batches for 4–5 minutes, until soft but not browned. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Fry the fish: Heat the oil to 180°C (350°F). Pat the fish fillets dry, dust lightly with flour, then dip in the batter and fry until golden and crisp—about 5–7 minutes. Drain on a rack or paper towels.</li>
            <li>Finish the chips: Return the chips to the oil at 180°C (350°F) and fry again until golden and crispy, about 2–3 minutes. Serve everything hot with lemon wedges, vinegar, and your favorite sides.</li>
        </ol>

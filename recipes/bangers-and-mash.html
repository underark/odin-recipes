        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Bangers and mash is a beloved British comfort food that keeps things simple but satisfying. 
            At its heart, it’s just sausages and mashed potatoes—but when done right, it hits all the right notes. 
            Juicy, well-browned sausages are served atop creamy mash, then drenched in a rich onion gravy 
            that ties everything together in a cozy, pub-style hug.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perfect for weeknights or rainy days, bangers and mash is as versatile as it is hearty. 
            You can use classic pork sausages, herby Cumberland, or even plant-based versions if you like. 
            The mash can be dressed up with butter, cream, or mustard, and the gravy can go as deep and dark as your onions allow. 
            It's unfussy, deeply comforting, and just the thing when you want food that doesn’t mess around.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the sausages: In a frying pan over medium heat, cook your sausages (pork, beef, or veggie) until browned and cooked through, turning regularly—this usually takes about 15–20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Boil the potatoes: While the sausages cook, peel and chop your potatoes, then boil them in salted water until fork-tender—around 15 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Make the mash: Mash the potatoes with butter, a splash of milk or cream, salt, and pepper until smooth and fluffy. Optional: add a spoonful of mustard for extra kick.</li>
            <li>Prepare the onion gravy: In a separate pan, slowly cook sliced onions in butter or oil until soft and golden. Stir in a spoonful of flour, cook briefly, then gradually add stock, stirring until the gravy thickens.</li>
            <li>Assemble and serve: Plate up the mash, top with sausages, and pour over a generous helping of onion gravy. Serve hot and enjoy your proper plate of comfort.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Creamy, comforting, and packed with tender chunks of fish, fish pie is a classic British dish that brings warmth to any dinner table.
            Traditionally made with a medley of white fish, smoked haddock, and sometimes salmon,
            it's gently poached in a flavorful white sauce before being topped with a buttery mashed potato crust.
            The result is a rich, savory bake with just the right balance of texture and taste.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're feeding a crowd or just craving something hearty, fish pie is a reliable go-to.
            It’s endlessly adaptable—toss in some peas or hard-boiled eggs, switch up the fish, or add a splash of cream for extra indulgence.
            This recipe keeps things simple and family-friendly, with straightforward steps and plenty of opportunity to make it your own.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the fish: Cut your fish (such as cod, smoked haddock, and salmon) into chunks and poach gently in milk with a bay leaf and a few peppercorns until just cooked. Remove the fish and set aside, reserving the milk.</li>
            <li>Make the white sauce: In a saucepan, melt butter and stir in flour to make a roux. Gradually whisk in the reserved poaching milk, cooking until thickened. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg if you like.</li>
            <li>Assemble the filling: Gently fold the cooked fish into the sauce along with any extras like peas, chopped parsley, or sliced boiled eggs. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Top with mash: Spread prepared mashed potatoes evenly over the fish filling, fluffing the top with a fork for a crispier texture once baked.</li>
            <li>Bake and serve: Bake in a preheated oven at 200°C (180°C fan) for about 25–30 minutes, or until the top is golden and the filling is bubbling. Let it rest briefly before serving.</li>
